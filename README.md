**I made five with the help of Jehovah, Five is a programming language, like four, for create applications, but with more functions, more updated.**

**Five Example**

```five
> app.four
> This is an example with love
project.name = "MyApplication"
project.platform = "all"
require "shell"
shell.set = "python3"
> You need to make a class named shell, and a function inside the class named "main".
define class "shell"
  function "main"
# After class shell and function main, you exit five.
print('Hi!')
```
For compile:

```bash
five compile app.four
```
🧑‍💻 **For run:**

```bash
five run MyApplication.app
```
